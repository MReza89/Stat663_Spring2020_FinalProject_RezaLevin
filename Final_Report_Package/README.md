    We implement the affinity propagation clustering algorithm developed in \citet{FreyDueck07} using Python. Affinity propagation works by passing messages between data points to find exemplars amongst them. Advantages of affinity propagation over other clustering methods such as \textit{k}-means or \textit{k}-centers include the ability to easily alter the number of clusters and significant computational ease. Furthermore, affinity propagation does not require an exact number of clusters to be specified \textit{a priori}. The algorithm is deterministic, without random initialization of parameters. Finally, affinity propagation can be applied with non-standard measures of similarity. We apply our algorithm to several simulated and real datasets and explore its performance.
